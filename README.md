### Intro
Visualization 2014 mlb hits on a generic baseball field using d3.js. Query by pitchers and hitters.

Used [mlb_terminal](https://github.com/slnovak/mlb_terminal) to fetch the data. Look in the public/data dir to find some scripts helping with wrangling this data. There's also a short ipython notebook that cleans it up a bit.

I'll be updating the dataset monthly or so.


### Running
```sh
$ npm start # after cloning the repo
```

### Future

Further work would be to create a better field, the current one is pretty solid but maybe there be work done to alter it to look at a particular MLB field(s).
